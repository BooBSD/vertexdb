ToDo

- complete tests in test/test.io (ok to use a python script instead)

- make sure docs are in sync with code

- add performance tests for:
	- writes, removes, reads per second
	- db size per number of writes
	- possibly look into tokyo cabinet tuning parameters

- FUSE interface

- start project to reimplement vertexdb in Lua or Javascript v8 with async sockets & tokyocabinet - this would allow us to use Lua or JS as a query language
