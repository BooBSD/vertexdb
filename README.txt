About

Vertex is a high performance graph database with a http interface, built on libevent and tokyocabinet. It's BSD licensed and was written by Steve Dekorte and Rich Collins.

Status

Currently only ready for tinkering. Still need to finish adding tests and permissions support and docs before it's ready for production use. 

Future

FUSE interface and may add support for more complex queries and dynamic/ automatic index creation based on observed queries.
